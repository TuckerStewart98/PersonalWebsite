		<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
		
		<!-- Personal Website. -->
		<h3>Personal Website (HTML and CSS)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Self-taught HTML and CSS.</li>
			<li>Created personal website for sharing resume and 
			projects using HTML and CSS.</li>
			<li>Website is hosted by the University of Washington 
			and can be accessed by: 
			http://students.washington.edu/trstew</li>
		</ul>
		
		<!-- Chat Bot for Discord. -->
		<h3>Bot for Discord (Java)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Created a (Chat) Bot for the communication 
			application Discord. The bot detects when a user starts 
			livestreaming using Twitch and/or Youtube then sends a 
			notification to all users on the same server with the 
			URL to the user’s livestreaming service.</li>
			<li>This was created as a Maven project using 
			DV8FromTheWorld’s JDA as a dependency and was deployed 
			using Heroku to connect the bot to Discord.</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		
		<!-- Class Projects. -->
		
		<h2>Class Projects</h2>
		
		<!-- Tetris project. -->
		<h3>Tetris (Java)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Developed the front-end of a Tetris game with a 
			provided Tetris model by implementing the Observer 
			design pattern.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<!-- Maze Generator project. -->
		<h3>Maze Generator (Java)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Created an algorithm that would generate a minimum spanning 
			tree from an MxN graph using a depth first search method to 
			represent a maze. Then the program solves the maze using a 
			depth first search algorithm.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<!-- Modeling a Race project. -->
		<h3>Modeling a Race (Java)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Created a model that would parse a file 
			representing a race, analyzed the data and created 
			usable information, then stored that information into 
			an array list for future access.</li>
			<li>Created a Graphical User Interface that would 
			control a timer and manipulate the model based on the 
			time along with other commands such as pause, play, and 
			restart.
		</ul>
		
		<!-- Undergraduate Research -->
		<h3>Research in Time-Series Forecasting/Data Science (Python)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Currently conducting Undergraduate Research into
			developing new methodologies for forecasting peak values
			in time-series under the guidance of
			<a id="Mentor1" href="https://faculty.washington.edu/juhuah/">Professor Juhua Hu</a>.
			</li>
			<li>An invaluable experience in how to research new
			knowledge independently, work through the Data Science life
			cycle, and to concisely and effectively present my work.</li>
		</ul>
		
		
				
		<!-- Relevant Classes. -->
		
		<h2>Relevant Classes</h2>
		
		<h3>TCSS 305: Programming Practicum</h3>
		<p>Programming Praticum introduces fundamental programming 
		concepts for Object-oriented design in designing medium scale projects. 
		Concepts include Observer Design Pattern, Graphical User 
		Interfaces, and Inheritance Hierarchy to create robust and 
		maintainable applications.</p>
		
		<h3>TCSS 333: C for Programming Systems</h3>
		<p>Introduces C as a programming language and its uses for 
		systems programming in a Linux environment. Covers concepts such 
		as pointers, dynamic memory allocation and the memory model, 
		system calls, how to construct Abstract Data Types in procedural 
		programming, and how to use a Linux/Unix environment through 
		bash.</p>
		
		<h3>TCSS 342: Data Structures</h3>
		<p>Discusses in depth how fundamental Data Structures are 
		designed so that performance of each Data Structure is 
		understood and gives an understanding of how Data Structures 
		can be implemented optimally for a given scenario.</p>
		
		<h3>TCSS 343: Design and Analysis of Algorithms</h3>
		<p>Teaches how to design and analyze complexity of algorithms.
		Covers very useful design patterns and famous algorithms to
		provide a basis for efficient and correct algorithm design.</p>
		
		<h3>TCSS 360: Software Development and Quality Assurance</h3>
		<p>Presents standard development practices in Software 
		Development to create quality software that is maintainable 
		and meets specifications. This encompasses working in a team 
		to write software specifications, designing and implementing an 
		application, creating a suite of tests for the application, and 
		then validating specifications.</p>
		
		<h3>TCSS 371: Machine Organization</h3>
		<p>Covers how computing systems are designed in terms of 
		hardware to develop the relationship between hardware and 
		software. This explores digital logic, machine organization, 
		assembly language, and teaches how to translate a high-level 
		programming language into a language understandable to a 
		machine.</p>
		
		<h3>TCSS 372: Computer Architecture</h3>
		<p>Covers the design of the micro-architecture level of machines
		and advanced architecture features that improve performance. Topics
		includes CPU design with respect to datapaths and pipelining,
		memory hierarchy, level of cache memory, virtual memory, and
		parallel processing.</p>
		
		<h3>TCSS 422: Computer Operating Systems</h3>
		<p>Covers components that important to the design of an Operating
		System such as process management, concurrency, inter-process
		communication, multi-threading, mutual exclusion, and security.</p>
		
		<h3>TCSS 435: Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Acquisition</h3>
		<p>Examines how the use of search algorithms, knowledge
		representation, and machine learning can be use to create
		'intelligent' systems.</p>
		
		<h3>TCSS 455: Introduction to Machine Learning</h3>
		<p>Explores the internals of different machine learning algorithms
		such as decision trees, random forests, Bayesian learning, neural
		networks, and clustering. Has students work in teams of three
		throughout the quarter on a classification problem, with the goal
		of increasing the accuracy of the classifier.</p>
		
		<h3>TCSS 481: Computer Security</h3>
		<p>Discusses topics related to network and system security such as
		symmetric and public-key cryptography. Provides examples of
		programming and protocol vulnerabilities to demonstrate how to
		exploit them and defend against the exploits.</p>
		
		<h3>TMATH 124-126: Calculus with Analytical Geometry I-III</h3>
		<p>Covers mathematical concepts such as derivatives, integrals, 
		sequences and series.</p>

		<p>Explores the different properties of first order and second
		order differential equations. Also covers Laplace Transform and
		systems of differential equations.</p>
		
		<h3>TMATH 308: Matrix Algebra</h3>
		<p>Introduces Linear Algebra, covering concepts about systems of 
		linear equation, algebra for matrices, vector and Euclidean 
		spaces, linear independence, eignevectors, and eigenvalues.</p>
		
		<h3>TMATH 390: Probability and Statistics for Engineers and 
		Scientists</h3>
		<p>Teaches how to analyze data for Engineering and Scientific 
		disciplines. Discusses topics on distributions, conditional 
		probability, descriptive and inferential statistics, sampling 
		errors, and confidence intervals.</p>
